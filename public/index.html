      What exactly is a Markov Chain?
    </div>
    <div class="content-info">
      To understand what a Markov chain is, first consider a problem
      that it is trying to solve. Given a set of states, and probabilities of
      transitioning from some state S<sub>i</sub> to some state S<sub>j</sub>,
      can we predict the sequence that will likely come from some state S<sub>k</sub>?
      <p><p>
      We can generate a possible sequence, by looking at potential transitions from
      S<sub>k</sub> and make an educated guess at what the next state will be.
      An easy way to organize all of the potential transitions, is in a transition
      matrix. Here is an example of a transition matrix that only involves the
      states R, N and S.
    </div>
    <div class="content-image">
      <img class="matrix-img" src="/public/img/TransitionMatrix.png"></img>
    </div>
    <div class="content-info">
      In this matrix, the value at position <i>i,j</i> in the matrix is equal to
      the probability that given the current state is S<sub>i</sub> that
      the next state will be S<sub>j</sub>. For example, half the time R will
      actually loop back to itself, which is why R,R has a value of 1/2. One
      fourth of the time, R will transition to N, so R,N has a value of 1/4.
      In order to generate a sequence, a starting state is picked, and then each
      consecutive state will be picked based on the probability given in the matrix.
      <p><p>
      What is great about this, is given a large number of sequences, we can
      create our own probability matrix by counting each transition between some
      S<sub>i</sub> and some S<sub>j</sub>. For example, if we find that throughout
      all of our sequences, S<sub>1</sub> goes to S<sub>2</sub> 5 times,
      S<sub>1</sub> goes to S<sub>0</sub> 2 times and S<sub>1</sub> goes to S<sub>1</sub> 3 times,
      then the probability of S<sub>1</sub> going to S<sub>0</sub>, S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>
      is .2, .3 and .5 respectively. When we decide to generate a new sequence,
      if we are at S<sub>1</sub> then the next state will be S<sub>0</sub> one fifth of the time,
      S<sub>1</sub> three tenths of the time, and S<sub>2</sub> half the time.
      <p><p>
      These sequences can be created by any seqential data. In our example here, we are using
      tweets. Each state is a word in a tweet. We scan over hundreds of thousands
      of tweets to create this matrix that will tell us given the word "and", what are the likely
      words that Donald Trump will say next? This can be saved in a matrix as described above and
      used to create new sentences that will sound similar to the sentences that he has created himself!
